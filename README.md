It is a supervised machine learning technique, used to predict the value of the dependent variable for new, unseen data. It models the relationship between the input features and the target variable, allowing for the estimation or prediction of numerical values.

Regression analysis problem works with if output variable is a real or continuous value, such as “salary” or “weight”. Many different models can be used, the simplest is the linear regression. It tries to fit data with the best hyper-plane which goes through the points.
